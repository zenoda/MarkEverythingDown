Qwen2.5-VL Technical Report
Qwen Team, Alibaba Group
https://chat.qwenlm.aihttps://huggingface.co/Qwen
https://modelscope.cn/organization/qwenhttps://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5-VL
Abstract
We introduce Qwen2.5-VL, the latest ﬂagship model of Qwen vision-language series,
which demonstrates signiﬁcant advancements in both foundational capabilities and
innovative functionalities. Qwen2.5-VL achieves a major leap forward in understanding
and interacting with the world through enhanced visual recognition, precise object local-
ization, robust document parsing, and long-video comprehension. A standout feature of
Qwen2.5-VL is its ability to localize objects using bounding boxes or points accurately. It
provides robust structured data extraction from invoices, forms, and tables, as well as
detailed analysis of charts, diagrams, and layouts. To handle complex inputs, Qwen2.5-
VL introduces dynamic resolution processing and absolute time encoding, enabling it
to process images of varying sizes and videos of extended durations (up to hours) with
second-level event localization. This allows the model to natively perceive spatial scales
and temporal dynamics without relying on traditional normalization techniques. By
training a native dynamic-resolution Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch and incorpo-
rating Window Attention, we have signiﬁcantly reduced computational overhead while
maintaining native resolution. As a result, Qwen2.5-VL excels not only in static image
and document understanding but also as an interactive visual agent capable of reasoning,
tool usage, and task execution in real-world scenarios such as operating computers and
mobile devices. The model achieves strong generalization across domains without requir-
ing task-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning. Qwen2.5-VL is available in three sizes, addressing diverse
use cases from edge AI to high-performance computing. The ﬂagship Qwen2.5-VL-72B
model matches state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, particularly
excelling in document and diagram understanding. The smaller Qwen2.5-VL-7B and
Qwen2.5-VL-3B models outperform comparable competitors, offering strong capabilities
even in resource-constrained environments. Additionally, Qwen2.5-VL maintains robust
linguistic performance, preserving the core language competencies of the Qwen2.5 LLM.

1Introduction
Large vision-language models ( LVLMs ) ( OpenAI ,2024;Anthropic ,2024a ;Team et al. ,2023;Wang et al. ,
2024f ) represent a pivotal breakthrough in artiﬁcial intelligence, signaling a transformative approach to
multimodal understanding and interaction. By seamlessly integrating visual perception with natural
language processing, these advanced models are fundamentally reshaping how machines interpret and
analyze complex information across diverse domains. Despite signiﬁcant advancements in multimodal
large language models, the current capabilities of these models can be likened to the middle layer of a
sandwich cookie—competent across various tasks but falling short of exceptional performance. Fine-
grained visual tasks form the foundational layer of this analogy. In this iteration of Qwen2.5-VL, we
are committed to exploring ﬁne-grained perception capabilities, aiming to establish a robust foundation
for LVLMs and create an agentic ampliﬁer for real-world applications. The top layer of this framework
is multi-modal reasoning, which is enhanced by leveraging the latest Qwen2.5 LLM and employing
multi-modal QA data construction.
A spectrum of works have promoted the development of multimodal large models, characterized by
architectural design, visual input processing, and data curation. One of the primary drivers of progress
in LVLMs is the continuous innovation in architecture. The studies presented in ( Alayrac et al. ,2022;
Li et al. ,2022a ;2023b ;Liu et al. ,2023b ;a;Wang et al. ,2024i ;Zhang et al. ,2024b ;Wang et al. ,2023) have
incrementally shaped the current paradigm, which typically consists of a visual encoder, a cross-modal
projector, and LLM. Fine-grained perception models have emerged as another crucial area. Models like
(Xiao et al. ,2023;Liu et al. ,2023c ;Ren et al. ,2024;Zhang et al. ,2024a ;d;Peng et al. ,2023;Deitke et al. ,
2024) have pushed the boundaries of what is possible in terms of detailed visual understanding. The
architectures of Omni ( Li et al. ,2024g ;2025b ;Ye et al. ,2024) and MoE ( Riquelme et al. ,2021;Lee et al. ,
2024;Li et al. ,2024h ;c;Wu et al. ,2024b ) also inspire the future evolution of LVLMs. Enhancements in
visual encoders ( Chen et al. ,2023;Liu et al. ,2024b ;Liang et al. ,2025) and resolution scaling ( Li et al. ,
2023c ;Ye et al. ,2023;Li et al. ,2023a ) have played a pivotal role in improving the quality of practical
visual understanding. Curating data with more diverse scenarios and higher-quality is an essential step
in training advanced LVLMs. The efforts proposed in ( Guo et al. ,2024;Chen et al. ,2024d ;Liu et al. ,2024a ;
Chen et al. ,2024a ;Tong et al. ,2024;Li et al. ,2024a ) are highly valuable contributions to this endeavor.
However, despite their remarkable progress, vision-language models currently face developmental
bottlenecks, including computational complexity, limited contextual understanding, poor ﬁne-grained
visual perception, and inconsistent performance across varied sequence length.
In this report, we introduce the latest work Qwen2.5-VL, which continues the open-source philosophy of
the Qwen series, achieving and even surpassing top-tier closed-source models on various benchmarks.
Technically, our contributions are four-folds: (1) We implement window attention in the visual encoder to
optimize inference efﬁciency; (2) We introduce dynamic FPS sampling, extending dynamic resolution to
the temporal dimension and enabling comprehensive video understanding across varied sampling rates;
(3) We upgrade MRoPE in the temporal domain by aligning to absolute time, thereby facilitating more
sophisticated temporal sequence learning; (4) We make signiﬁcant efforts in curating high-quality data
for both pre-training and supervised ﬁne-tuning, further scaling the pre-training corpus from 1.2 trillion
tokens to 4.1 trillion tokens.
The sparkling characteristics of Qwen2.5-VL are as follows:
•Powerful document parsing capabilities: Qwen2.5-VL upgrades text recognition to omni-
document parsing, excelling in processing multi-scene, multilingual, and various built-in (hand-
writing, tables, charts, chemical formulas, and music sheets) documents.
•Precise object grounding across formats: Qwen2.5-VL unlocks improved accuracy in detecting,
pointing, and counting objects, accommodating absolute coordinate and JSON formats for
advanced spatial reasoning.
•Ultra-long video understanding and ﬁne-grained video grounding: Our model extends native
dynamic resolution to the temporal dimension, enhancing the ability to understand videos lasting
hours while extracting event segments in seconds.
•Enhanced agent Functionality for computer and mobile devices: Leverage advanced grounding,
reasoning, and decision-making abilities, boosting the model with superior agent functionality
on smartphones and computers.

I was inspired to create this project when randomly browsing Andrej Karpathy's X and I saw this tweet:

```text
It's 2025 and most content is still written for humans instead of LLMs. 99.9% of attention is about to be LLM attention, not human attention.

E.g. 99% of libraries still have docs that basically render to some pretty .html static pages assuming a human will click through them. In 2025 the docs should be a single your_project.md text file that is intended to go into the context window of an LLM.

Repeat for everything.
```

So I thought, why not create a tool that can convert any document into a LLM-friendly format? And here we are!

In addition, this project won't be possible without the amazing work of the Qwen team and the open-source community. Special thanks to the developers of the Qwen2.5 VL models and the various libraries used in this project.
